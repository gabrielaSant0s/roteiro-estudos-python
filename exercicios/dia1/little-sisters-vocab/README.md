# Instructions

You are helping your younger sister with her English vocabulary homework, which she's finding very tedious.
 Her class is learning to create new words by adding _prefixes_ and _suffixes_.
 Given a set of words, the teacher is looking for correctly transformed words with correct spelling by adding the prefix to the beginning or the suffix to the ending.

There's four activities in the assignment, each with a set of text or words to work with.


## 1. Add a prefix to a word

One of the most common prefixes in English is `un`, meaning "not".
 In this activity, your sister needs to make negative, or "not" words by adding `un` to them.

Implement the `add_prefix_un()` function that takes `word` as a parameter and returns a new `un` prefixed word:


```python
>>> add_prefix_un("happy")
'unhappy'
>>> add_prefix_un("manageable")
'unmanageable'
```


## 2. Add prefixes to word groups

There are four more common prefixes that your sister's class is studying:
 `en` (_meaning to 'put into' or 'cover with'_),
 `pre` (_meaning 'before' or 'forward'_),
 `auto` (_meaning 'self' or 'same'_),
  and `inter` (_meaning 'between' or 'among'_).

 In this exercise, the class is creating groups of vocabulary words using these prefixes, so they can be studied together.
 Each prefix comes in a list with common words it's used with.
 The students need to apply the prefix and produce a string that shows the prefix applied to all of the words.

Implement the `make_word_groups(<vocab_words>)` function that takes a `vocab_words` as a parameter in the following form:
 `[<prefix>, <word_1>, <word_2> .... <word_n>]`, and returns a string with the prefix applied to each word that looks like:
  `'<prefix> :: <prefix><word_1> :: <prefix><word_2> :: <prefix><word_n>'`.


```python
>>> make_word_groups(['en', 'close', 'joy', 'lighten'])
'en :: enclose :: enjoy :: enlighten'
>>> make_word_groups(['pre', 'serve', 'dispose', 'position'])
'pre :: preserve :: predispose :: preposition'
>> make_word_groups(['auto', 'didactic', 'graph', 'mate'])
'auto :: autodidactic :: autograph :: automate'
>>> make_word_groups(['inter', 'twine', 'connected', 'dependent'])
'inter :: intertwine :: interconnected :: interdependent'
```


## 3. Remove a suffix from a word

`ness` is a common suffix that means _'state of being'_.
 In this activity, your sister needs to find the original root word by removing the `ness` suffix.
  But of course there are pesky spelling rules: If the root word originally ended in a consonant followed by a 'y', then the 'y' was changed to 'i'.
 Removing 'ness' needs to restore the 'y' in those root words. e.g. `happiness` --> `happi` --> `happy`.

Implement the `remove_suffix_ness(<word>)` function that takes in a word `str`, and returns the root word without the `ness` suffix.


```python
>>> remove_suffix_ness("heaviness")
'heavy'
>>> remove_suffix_ness("sadness")
'sad'
```

## 4. Extract and transform a word

Suffixes are often used to change the part of speech a word has.
 A common practice in English is "verbing" or "verbifying" -- where an adjective _becomes_ a verb by adding an `en` suffix.

In this task, your sister is going to practice "verbing" words by extracting an adjective from a sentence and turning it into a verb.
 Fortunately, all the words that need to be transformed here are "regular" - they don't need spelling changes to add the suffix.

Implement the `adjective_to_verb(<sentence>, <index>)` function that takes two parameters.
 A `sentence` using the vocabulary word, and the `index` of the word, once that sentence is split apart.
 The function should return the extracted adjective as a verb.


```python
>>> adjective_to_verb('I need to make that bright.', -1 )
'brighten'
>>> adjective_to_verb('It got dark as the sun set.', 2)
'darken'
```
